# Implement-RAG
Implement a graph based RAG (Retrieval Augment Generation) system using Langgraph and Langchain for a cybersecurity / penetration testing use-case.


Graph-Based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System for Cybersecurity

1. Overview

The Graph-Based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is designed for cybersecurity and penetration testing. This system dynamically constructs a graph representing network entities, such as hosts, ports, services, vulnerabilities, and credentials, and leverages this data to answer user queries about network security. The goal is to create an intelligent system that can automatically ingest scan data and answer complex security-related queries in real-time.

Technologies Used

	•	Langchain and Langgraph: Frameworks for building graph-based systems and performing retrieval-augmented generation.
	•	MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store network scan results.
	•	Nmap: Network scanner to gather information about open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
	•	Poetry: Python dependency manager.
	•	Python 3.11: Python version for development.
	•	Docker: For containerization of the application.

2. Project Setup

2.1 Prerequisites

	1.	System Requirements:
	•	Python 3.11+.
	•	Poetry for dependency management.
	•	MongoDB installed locally or via a cloud provider (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
	•	Docker for containerizing the application.
	•	Nmap installed on the system for network scanning.
	2.	Install Dependencies:
	•	Install Poetry for managing the project environment:

brew install poetry


	•	Create a new project and install dependencies:

mkdir graph-rag-system
cd graph-rag-system
poetry init
poetry add langchain langgraph pymongo nmap
poetry install


	3.	MongoDB Setup:
	•	Set up MongoDB on your local machine or use a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.
	•	Ensure MongoDB is running on the default port 27017.
	4.	Docker Setup:
	•	For containerization, the Dockerfile is provided to run the application inside a container:

docker build -t graph-rag-system .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 graph-rag-system



3. Data Collection

3.1 Objective

The objective of this step is to collect network-related data using Nmap and store it in a MongoDB database. The collected data will be used to construct a graph representing the relationships between hosts, ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

3.2 Data to Collect

The following network-related entities and their relationships need to be captured:

	1.	Entities:
	•	Host: The target system, identified by its IP address.
	•	Port: Open network ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).
	•	Service: The service running on an open port (e.g., SSH, HTTP).
	•	Vulnerability: Potential security issues related to services.
	•	Credential: Usernames and passwords associated with services.
	2.	Relations:
	•	A host can have multiple ports.
	•	A port runs a specific service.
	•	Services can have associated vulnerabilities and credentials.

3.3 Data Collection Process

	1.	Nmap Scan:
	•	The nmap tool is used to perform a scan of a specified host and collect details such as open ports and services running on those ports.
	•	The script automatically collects this data and stores it in MongoDB.
	2.	Data Storage:
	•	The collected data is stored in a MongoDB database under the blackcoffer database and the hosts collection.
	•	Each document in the hosts collection represents a single host and contains information about the host’s open ports, services, and related vulnerabilities.

3.4 Data Collection Script Example

import nmap
from pymongo import MongoClient

# MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client['blackcoffer']
collection = db['hosts']

# Nmap scan setup
nm = nmap.PortScanner()

# Example: Scanning the target
target = '192.168.1.1'  # Replace with your target IP
nm.scan(hosts=target, arguments='-p 1-1024')

def store_scan_results():
    for host in nm.all_hosts():
        host_data = {
            "_id": host,
            "host": host,
            "ports": []
        }

        for port in nm[host].all_tcp():
            service = nm[host]['tcp'][port]['name']
            host_data['ports'].append({
                "port": port,
                "service": service,
                "vulnerabilities": [],
                "credentials": []
            })

        collection.insert_one(host_data)

# Store scan results in MongoDB
store_scan_results()

3.5 MongoDB Data Structure

{
  "_id": "192.168.1.1",
  "host": "192.168.1.1",
  "ports": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "service": "ssh",
      "vulnerabilities": [],
      "credentials": []
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "service": "http",
      "vulnerabilities": [],
      "credentials": []
    }
  ]
}

4. Graph-Based RAG Pipeline

4.1 Objective

The goal of this pipeline is to build a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. The system will answer user queries based on the data collected in the previous step (Nmap scan results stored in MongoDB).

4.2 Graph Construction

	1.	Entities and Relations:
	•	The graph will consist of nodes representing entities (hosts, ports, services) and edges representing the relationships between them.
	2.	Langchain and Langgraph Integration:
	•	Use Langchain and Langgraph to construct the graph and query the database for relevant information.
	•	The graph will dynamically update as new data arrives, either via manual updates or automated scans.
	3.	Graph Representation:
	•	Nodes: Represent hosts, ports, services, vulnerabilities, and credentials.
	•	Edges: Define the relationships between entities (e.g., host -> port -> service).
	4.	Graph Querying:
	•	Use Langchain’s query system to answer user queries related to network security, such as:
	•	What ports are running on a target host?
	•	What vulnerabilities exist on a particular service?

4.3 Inference Pipeline

	1.	Inference Tasks:
	•	When a user asks a question, the system will:
	1.	Retrieve the relevant context from the graph.
	2.	Use the context to generate an accurate response.
	2.	Example Queries:
	•	What services are running on 192.168.1.1?
	•	Are there any vulnerabilities in the SSH service on 192.168.1.1?

5. Performance Benchmarking

5.1 Query Response Time

	1.	Benchmarking the Graph Query:
	•	Measure the time it takes from receiving a query to generating a response, including the time spent retrieving relevant data from the graph.
	2.	Optimization:
	•	Implement indexing in MongoDB to speed up data retrieval.
	•	Optimize Langchain queries for faster response times.

6. Containerization with Docker

6.1 Dockerfile

For ease of deployment and execution, the project has been containerized using Docker. The following Dockerfile was created to build and run the application inside a container.

# Use Python 3.11 image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock /app/
RUN pip install poetry && poetry install

# Copy the application code
COPY . /app

# Run the application
CMD ["poetry", "run", "python", "src/main.py"]

6.2 Running the Container

To build and run the container:

docker build -t graph-rag-system .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 graph-rag-system

7. Deployment on AWS (Bonus)

7.1 API Deployment

	1.	Create an API endpoint on AWS to expose the functionality of the RAG pipeline.
	2.	API Functions:
	•	POST /graph: Create or update a graph based on provided data.
	•	GET /graph/{graph_id}: Retrieve a graph by ID for querying.
	3.	Lambda Functions:
	•	Use AWS Lambda functions to deploy the API and handle requests to update or query the graph.
